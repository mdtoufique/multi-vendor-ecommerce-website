# 🛒 Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform (Final Year Project)

This is a full-stack **multi-vendor e-commerce platform** developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform allows multiple independent sellers to list and sell their products, while buyers can browse, order, and interact with sellers. Admins can monitor all activities and manage the system in real-time.
